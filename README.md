# SQL Analysis of Book Success Factors

This project demonstrates SQL queries used to explore factors contributing to the success of books related to data science, statistics, Python, and machine learning. Using a dataset of 900+ books, I investiage the relationship between books attributes such as __rating__, **number of reviews**, and **price** to answer key questions about what makes a book successful.
